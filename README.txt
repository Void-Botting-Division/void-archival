How to use
---
Windows? 
- Install Python 3.13, then open your terminal on this folder and then run "./scripts/activate.ps1"
- Run 'pip install'
- Edit the things from "settings.ini" like the bot token and server to output. 
-- "output" is where do you want the archive to be (server id). "archive" is the server id that you want to archive
- After that run "py main.py" and you're good to go.
