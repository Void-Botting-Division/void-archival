## How to use
---
### Windows? 
- Install Pyhton 3.13, Download [DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/releases/tag/2.44) and rename the folder to just "DiscordChatExporter", then drop it aside the python script.
- Edit the things from "settings.ini" like the bot token and server to output.
 - "output" is where do you want the archive to be (server id). "archive" is the server id that you want to archive
- After that run "py main.py" and you're good to go.
